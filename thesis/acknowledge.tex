First and foremost, I [...] my advisor and mentor, Kathryn Johnston, for years of [...] and whose intuition and brilliance is matched by her supportive and light-hearted nature. [Something about catalyst for ideas]. 

I owe so much to David Hogg, but here I would like to thank him for first getting me interested in astronomy. I have always been interested in science and astronomy, but I didn't think I wanted to be or could be a scientist. I started my undergraduate career in technical theater at the Tisch school for the arts at NYU. After one semester I knew that I wanted to switch majors, but it wasn't until I took Physics 1 (taught by Hogg) that I knew I wanted to do \emph{whatever that guy did}. Over the last ten years or so, he has been an invaluable mentor, good influence, bad influence, and friend.
