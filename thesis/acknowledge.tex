First and foremost, I am privileged to have had Kathryn Johnston as my advisor and mentor for the last four years. I could thank her for [...], but I am so grateful that she was such a catalyst for ideas.

Her intuition and [...] is matched by her supportive, patient, and light-hearted nature. I can't [...] a better mentor and [...]---thanks also for putting up with me!

I owe a lot to David Hogg, but here I would like to thank him for being the one to get me interested in astronomy. I have always been interested in science and astronomy, but I didn't think I wanted to be or could be a scientist. I started my undergraduate career in technical theater at the Tisch School for the Arts at NYU. After one semester I knew that I wanted to switch majors, but it wasn't until I took Physics 1 (taught by Hogg) that I knew I wanted to do \emph{whatever that guy did}. Over the last ten years or so, he has been an invaluable mentor, good influence, bad influence, and friend.
