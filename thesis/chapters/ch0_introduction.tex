\noindent{\bf  A few paragraphs to start -- very general, low-level intro to astronomy?}

\noindent{\bf Part 1: The Milky Way, our Galaxy}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Our place in the galaxy -- not too hot, not too cold
	\item Components of the galaxy -- separate subsections for disk, bulge / bar, halo
	\item Just one galaxy, but the one galaxy where we can measure precise kinematics for individual stars and have vast numbers of tracers
	\item Different ways to use stars in halo to measure mass, shape: random tracers (e.g., Jeans) vs. cold tracers (stream modeling)
	\item Evidence for dark matter and tentative clues to its structure (e.g., lensing, and conclusions all over the place for MW halo shape from streams)
	\item Can understand the MW to inform studies of galaxy evolution in general
\end{itemize}

\noindent{\bf  Part 2: The Milky Way in context}
\begin{itemize}
	\item MW satellites, LMC/SMC, M31, Local group, etc.
	\item MW is just one galaxy, and just one type of galaxy -- there are many different types of galaxies across a range of masses
	\item Brief intro to cosmology and standard lore for galaxy formation and evolution
	\item DM theories like $\Lambda$CDM predict specific geometries for DM halo structure. Can we measure this? What are the implications?
\end{itemize}

\noindent{\bf  Part 3: The Milky Way Halo, observations and census}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Surveys that will get kinematics for stars in the halo (ongoing and future surveys)
	\item Revolution in distance precision from tracers like RR Lyrae and spectral methods (twins), revolution in transverse velocity (Gaia)
	\item Types of substructure (shells, streams)
	\item Census of known dwarf galaxies, GCs, streams, shells, etc. -- what are their properties?
\end{itemize}

\noindent{\bf  Part 4: Dynamics intro (from beginning of chaos paper)?}
\noindent{\bf  Part 5: Statistics intro?}
