\title{Measuring the Gravitational Potential of the Milky Way}
\author{Adrian M. Price-Whelan}

\section{Introduction}

A great surprise from the last century of concerted efforts in both cosmological theory and observation is that familiar, baryonic matter is perhaps instead the exception: dwarfed in mass by the apparent existence of \emph{dark matter} and even further diminished by cosmic acceleration due to \emph{dark energy}, it seems that the Universe cares little for ordinary atoms and interactions. Yet, irony lies in the fact that the firmness of this conclusion relies on observations of a number of \emph{baryonic} probes, e.g., the orbits of stars and gas in the Milky Way (rubin 1970, other papers on the rotation curve / Oort problem), large-scale interactions between galaxy clusters (bullet cluster), gravitational lensing of galaxies (), the clustering of galaxies (), and pulsating (cite cepheid) and exploding (cite perlmutter/riess) stars. Dark-matter-only simulations of structure formation have demonstrated the dominance of the dark sector on large ($\gtrsim$100~kpc) scales by reproducing observational clustering statistics with impressive accuracy (cite) and also revealing the ubiquity and universal properties of dark matter \emph{halos} around galaxies \citep{navarro96} (others?). However, simply including baryons as passive followers of the dark matter does not carry this consistency to smaller ($\lesssim$10~kpc), galactic scales. It now seems that the processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution are not simply dictated by the dark matter, and the universality of dark matter halo profiles and shapes is also being questioned: relaxation and energetic feedback from the baryons has been shown to alter the interior structure of halos \citep[e.g.][]{bailin05, pontzen12} (more, maybe also a debatista paper? flattening of potential). Hence, detailed measurements of the shape, orientation, radial profile, and extent of dark matter halos provides information about the cosmological formation of these vast structures, as well as the smaller-scale baryonic processes that continue to shape them.

[ What has been done? ]
[ - initial work on DM density / Oort problem ]
[ - rotation curve ]
[ - 2D projected mapping w/ lensing ]
[ - kinematic tracer populations ]
[ - substructure ]
(*all are important* - confirmations of each other)

[ Overview of satellites and substructure in the halo ]

[ Status of software in astronomy ]

[ Overview of outreach activities etc? ]

\section{\texttt{REWIND}}

[ Discussion of other modeling techniques ]
[ - Deason et al. tracers ]
[ - Action-angle stuff (not easily applied to *real data*) ]
[ - Law \& Majewski model, why Nbody is tough ]

[ We want to model the potential that: ]
[ - exploits the substructure and kinematically associated stars ]
[ - can run on real observational data, with missing dimensions, no assumptions about analytic form of potential ]
[ - avoids building and running a fully dynamical model of a disrupting satellite (e.g., Nbody simulation for every step in parameter space) ]
